Data scraping and analysis of in-state blue-chip ratio and S&P+ ranking for CFB teams.

I wanted to see if the recruiting bit about "playing for your state" actually works and generates good teams. Here's the data that backed my analysis.

Steps:
* Clone the repo
* In a Terminal window, run `npm install`.
* Generate data by changing the variables `selectedTeam` and `blueChipFilter` in `crooting.js` and running `node crooting.js` in a Terminal window.
* View a chart of the data you've generated by changing the variables `selectedTeam` and `blueChipFilter` in `index.html` to point to the right JSON file from `/results`.
* In a Terminal window, `cd` into the project root directory and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` to spin up a HTTP server.
* In a browser, navigate to `localhost:<port>`, where the port is specified by the output of spinning up the HTTP server.

Data sources:

* FootballOutsiders.com for S&P+ data from 2005 to 2018.
* collegefootballdata API for the recruiting data from 2002 to 2019.
* /r/ZenGMBasketballCoach for NCAA Div1 team data (more details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZenGMBasketballCoach/comments/35j0yy/320team_json_file_with_ncaa_schools_locations/)).
