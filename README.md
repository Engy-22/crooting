Data scraping and analysis of in-state blue-chip ratio and S&P+ ranking for CFB teams.

I wanted to see if the recruiting bit about "playing for your state" actually works and generates good teams. Here's the data that backed it.

Sources:

* FootballOutsiders.com for S&P+ data from 2005 to 2018.
* collegefootballdata API for the recruiting data from 2002 to 2019.
* /r/ZenGMBasketballCoach for NCAA Div1 team data (more details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZenGMBasketballCoach/comments/35j0yy/320team_json_file_with_ncaa_schools_locations/)).
